    <h1> Project </h1>
    <p>
        The programme will promote an ethos of collaboration, practical application, and innovation. A project module will
        be included at each stage of the programme (apart from semester 1) that, through individual and collaborative
        projects, will challenge students to combine the knowledge and skills acquired in the various strands. Each project
        module will also elaborate on a theme, orthogonal to the programme disciplines, but central to the student’s
        individual development.

    <h2> Project Learning Path </h2>
    <p>
        The project will be assessed via a
        single report and presentation each semester. The report will demonstrate an artefact of the student’s choosing that
        integrates knowledge from two or more strands. This may be in the form of a software application, software/hardware
        combination, paper or combination of all of these. The ‘Orthogonal’ dimension must be addressed in the context of
        this report/presentation. The tuition team across each of the strands will stimulate project ideas and concepts for
        consideration by the students, who may take on board specific suggestions. Students as expected to proceed with
        ideas and concepts that particularly interest them individually, or collectively, in small teams.
